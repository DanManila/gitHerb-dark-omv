### **Other cosmetics settings** 
I use Google Font 'Source Code Pro Medium'. You know the drill - web search for Google Fonts, find the font you want, download it's ttf file, and (on Windows machines) double click that file to install.

My cosmetics-related modifications to workspace file 'settings.json':

Feedback appreciated. Really.
